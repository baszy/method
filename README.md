Experimental C++11 OpenGL 3D rendering engine. May be extended in the future 
to have more features specific to game programming. Hopefully it can be
changed to be more data-oriented soon. The engine is only Linux compatible at
the moment.

## Building on Linux
Move to the desired build directory (in-source builds are not recommended) and
invoke CMake: `cmake ./path/to/CMakeLists.txt`. The main library and test
program can then be built by running `make`.
